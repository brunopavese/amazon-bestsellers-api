# Amazon Bestsellers API

This project is an API that retrieves the top 3 best-selling items per category from the [Amazon Bestsellers](https://www.amazon.com.br/bestsellers) page. It is a serverless application built using AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway for HTTP requests, and DynamoDB as the database to store the data.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Axios
- Puppeteer for web scraping
- Serverless Framework
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS DynamoDB

## Description
This project is a serverless API that extracts the top three best-selling items per category from the Amazon Bestsellers page in Brazil (https://www.amazon.com.br/bestsellers). Using technologies like **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Express.js**, the API is deployed on **AWS Lambda** and configured with **AWS API Gateway** to handle HTTP requests. The data is stored in an **AWS DynamoDB** NoSQL database, where each category has an entry containing the current top three best-selling items.

Data collection from the Amazon page is achieved through web scraping using the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library. A local script is run to get web scraping data and update the database with the latest collected data, which consumes the API endpoint through a PUT request using **Axios**.
